/* The answers archive — the screen a viewer lands on straight off a Reel.
 *
 * The content is js/answers.js, which pipeline/build_answers.py generates from
 * the posted-video record. Nothing is written here; this file only draws it.
 *
 * FROM 2026-08-02 THIS IS THE DEFAULT LANDING SCREEN. A visitor with no deep
 * link and no progress lands here rather than on the road, because every
 * caption now says the answer is on the site and nowhere else — so "answers"
 * is the promise they are arriving with, and this is the page that keeps it.
 * app.js owns that decision (see entryPath there, and the 33% it is judged
 * against); this file reads it in boot() and never re-derives it. A deep link
 * still wins, and a visitor with progress still lands on the road.
 *
 * The other half of that change is `offerRoad` below: when a visitor leaves an
 * answer, the road's next question appears under it. Getting a reader to play
 * is the only reason this archive is worth landing anyone on.
 *
 * ==========================================================================
 * THE ANSWER COSTS AN EMAIL.  (program.md, "The answer is never free")
 * ==========================================================================
 * From 2026-08-02 a video withholds its answer everywhere — not on screen, not
 * in the caption, not in the first comment. This page is the ONLY place the
 * answer exists, and reading it costs one email address.
 *
 * So the page splits in two, and the split is the whole design:
 *
 *   FREE, and visible the instant they land — the date, the topic, the
 *   question in full, and the SHAPE of the working: how many steps, whether
 *   the numbers are laid out, how long it takes to read. Enough that the ask
 *   is obviously worth it, and not one word that resolves it.
 *
 *   BEHIND THE EMAIL — the answer lede (`a`) and the working (`why`).
 *
 * It is ONE ask, not one per answer. QQAuth.hasAccess() is the same predicate
 * the road's wall uses, so an address given anywhere opens every answer here,
 * for ever, on this device and on any device they sign in on.
 *
 * The copy says plainly what is happening: we want the email. No countdown, no
 * "one free answer left", no pretending an address is needed for a technical
 * reason. A bait-and-switch is what sours cold traffic; saying the price out
 * loud is what converts.
 *
 * THE ROAD IS NOT GATED BY ANY OF THIS. Unit 1 is free, no login, no wall,
 * exactly as it was — including the "play this one" button below, which stays
 * on the free side of the gate for a locked visitor. Somebody who would rather
 * solve it than be told is worth more to us than an email, not less.
 *
 * WHAT IT MUST NOT LEAK. Entry headings are quoted from what we published and
 * routinely give the answer away ("WHY 14 IS THE MINIMUM"), so the teaser
 * never shows one. The search index drops `a` while locked, so the box cannot
 * be used as an oracle to confirm a guess.
 *
 * It owns nothing else. Screens are switched with QQApp.go, exactly as every
 * other screen is; the email itself goes through QQApp.captureEmail, which is
 * the road's own capture path, so there is one auth seam and one event
 * vocabulary rather than two.

   *     second one is nagging, and nagging is what makes a page feel like a
   *     funnel rather than a thing worth reading.
   *   - it is shown to a locked visitor too. Someone who would rather solve
   *     it than pay an email for it is worth MORE to us, not less
   *     (site/README.md), so refusing the gate must not also cost them the
   *     road.
   *
   * And it is instrumented, because "they read and then left" and "they read
   * and then played" are the whole question and look identical without it:

   * question to offer, or the free door inside this entry already offered the
   * same lesson. Only about 4% of archive entries carry a road mapping, so for
   * the other ~96% this slot renders nothing at all.
   *
   * Meanwhile the paid libraries lived ONLY on the path screen. Over the 8 days
   * to 2026-08-22, 113 of 116 arrivals went to the archive, so at most 3% of
   * visitors could reach the shelf, and checkout_opened had read 0 since
   * launch. That is not weak demand, it is a shop with no door.
   *
   * WHERE THIS IS ALLOWED TO FIRE, and why it is deliberately narrow:
   *   - only when offerRoad would otherwise draw NOTHING. A road question
   *     always wins; the free product is the better offer and this must never
   *     compete with it.
   *   - only after the reader UNLOCKED an answer and reached the end of it.
   *     The gate converts 13% of views to an email and is the best number on
   *     the site. Nothing may be placed where it could cannibalise that, so
   *     this sits strictly after the email step, never beside it.

     * convert 0 from 12. Both groups see the identical gate. The difference is
     * what surrounds it — and `$('#ansHeadSub').hidden = !!focused` a few lines
     * below hides "One email opens all N of them" for exactly the deep-link
     * group. So the visitor who came for one specific answer is the only one
     * never told the email buys the other 92, and is asked to pay a price for
     * a single thing.
     *
     * This is NOT the copy the owner cut on 2026-08-02. That was a heading and
     * two paragraphs shown to everyone, arguing for the ask. This is one line,
     * on one path, restoring information that path uniquely lacks. The header
     * furniture stays hidden, so the answer is still the second thing on screen.
     *
     * HONEST ABOUT THE EVIDENCE: 0/12 against 3/14 is not significant — Fisher
     * gives about p=0.22 — so this is a hypothesis with a mechanism, not a
     * proven fix. Judge it on email_submitted per deep-link arrival, which is
     * 0 from 33 today. If it does not move once there are 20+ deep-link gates,
     * take it out. */
    /* The line that used to sit here is gone — see the note in render(). It
     * was given 24 deep-link gates to move a number that was 0, and the number
     * is still 0. The offer is now stated by #ansHeadSub, which that path can
     * see again. */

    /* 2026-08-04, third reading, and it is time to stop treating this as a
     * copy problem on this page.
     *
     * Seven days, split by entry path, counting SESSIONS:
     *
     *   browse (#answers)     37 gates, 55 gate views, 10 typed, 7 submitted
     *   deep link (#answers/) 38 gates, 38 gate views,  0 typed, 0 submitted
     *
     * Two things in there matter more than the totals. The deep-link group has
     * exactly one gate view per session — 38 from 38 — while the browse group
     * has 1.5, so a browser opens a second answer and a deep-linker never
     * does. And the deep-link group has ZERO email_attempted, not a poor
     * submit rate: nobody types anything. A broken form would show attempts
     * without submissions, so this is not a bug on this page.
     *
     * Two fixes have now been spent here — restoring "one email opens all N"
     * for this path, and the free play door on every answer — and neither
     * moved it off zero. The remaining untested lever is not on this page at
     * all: it is that we SEND people here. Every comment and DM link points at
     * #answers/<slug>. Pointing them at the archive index instead would put
     * that traffic on the path that demonstrably converts.
     *
     * Honest about the confound: deep-link traffic comes from comments and DMs
     * while browse traffic largely comes from the bio, so the two arms differ
     * in source as well as landing page, and the source may simply be worse
     * traffic. That is exactly why the next thing to try is the redirect —
     * it holds the source fixed and changes only the landing. The DM template
     * lives in the OpenReply app, not in this repo. */

    /* 2026-08-04, later the same night. Two things changed, and both make the
     * recommendation above STRONGER rather than merely older.
     *
     * ONE — the significance. The note above says "0/12 against 3/14 is not
     * significant — Fisher gives about p=0.22". Over 6 clean days the same
     * split now reads:
     *
     *   answers      (index)      82 arrivals, 54 gate views, 8 emails
     *   answers-deep-link         69 arrivals, 38 gate views, 0 emails
     *
     * At the index's own gate->email rate of 8/54, the chance of seeing zero
     * from 38 gate views is 0.852^38 = 0.002. This is no longer a hypothesis
     * with a mechanism. It is a result.
     *
     * TWO — the confound that would have killed it is ruled out. Zero emails
     * is exactly what you would expect if the deep-link visitors were ALREADY
     * SIGNED UP, because a returning user is never asked. Checked against
     * user_id on the events: of the 38 deep-link sessions that saw the gate,
     * 0 were authenticated, and only 1 deep-link session in 69 was
     * authenticated at all. They are 38 strangers who were shown the price and
     * declined it.
     *
     * WHAT IT IS WORTH. Deep-link arrivals run about 17/day. At the index's
     * observed 55% gate rate and 15% gate->email, moving that traffic would be
     * worth roughly 1.4 emails/day against a current total of 2.5/day.
     *
     * AND WHY IT IS STILL NOT DONE HERE. Every page-side lever is spent: the
     * "one email opens all N" line, the open card, and the full list rendered
     * underneath. The source-vs-landing confound in the note above is still
     * live and only the redirect separates them. Our own comment links are in
     * this repo (pipeline/answer_comments.py, pipeline/produce.py) but they no
     * longer fire — every post now carries the keyword caption, and publish.py
     * suppresses the answer comment under a post that charges for the answer.
     * So the DM really is the last remaining source, and it is owner-only. */

     * there was something worth paying for. Browsers meet the evidence first —
     * a list of 90-odd worked answers — and then choose to open one. So a
     * LOCKED deep link now lands on that same list with the answer they came
     * for at the top, collapsed, one tap away. Unlocked visitors still get it
     * opened immediately, because for them there is no price to soften.
     *
     * Judge it on email_submitted per deep-link ARRIVAL, currently 0 of 36.
     *
     * Per ARRIVAL, not per gate, and the distinction is the whole measurement.
     * Before this change every deep-link arrival was shown a gate immediately —
     * 36 arrivals, 36 gates. Now the gate only appears if they tap, so gate
     * COUNT is suppressed by design and will fall whether the change works or
     * not. An earlier version of this note set the kill criterion at "30 more
     * deep-link gates", which is a threshold this change actively prevents
     * being reached: it could have sat here for days looking inconclusive while
     * the number it waited on was one the code had deliberately removed.
     *
     * So: 30 more deep-link ARRIVALS. If emails are still 0 across them, the
     * landing is not the problem and the traffic itself is the thing to
     * question. A fall in gates shown is expected and is not evidence either
     * way. */
    /* THE COLLAPSE WAS A MISTAKE, AND AN ALREADY-MEASURED ONE (2026-08-04).
     *
     * The note a few lines below this one records that 49 of 65 archive
     * arrivals never opened a single card, and concludes: the list is the
     * problem, a wall of collapsed rows is a menu, so the first card arrives
     * open. I then collapsed the card for deep-link visitors and handed
     * exactly that menu to the one group already converting at zero.
     *
     * Measured after: 0 of 8 deep-link arrivals opened anything, against 3 of
     * 6 on the browse path — which still auto-opens. The asymmetry was mine.
     *
     * So the card opens again. What is KEPT from that change is the other
     * half, which was never the problem: #ansHeadSub and #ansTools stay
     * visible, so a deep-link visitor is told one email opens all of them and
     * can see there are more. Open card, offer stated, list underneath. */

       * Measured over the two days before this: 65 people reached the archive
       * and 49 of them never opened a single card, so 75% of the traffic our
       * own captions send here never met the gate, never saw a worked answer,
       * and could not have converted if they wanted to. The card is not the
       * problem — it already says "Answer, behind one email" and shows the
       * shape of the working. The LIST is the problem. app.js's own comment
       * says it: never show a cold visitor a menu, and a wall of 93 collapsed
       * rows is a menu.
       *
       * So the first card arrives open. The other 92 are still underneath, so
       * nothing is taken away — it is the difference between a filing cabinet
       * and a magazine left open on the table.
       *
       * Deliberately narrow: only on a cold LOAD, only with no deep link and
       * no search. Someone who typed a query, tapped back to the list, or
       * navigated within the archive has told us what they want and gets the
       * list they asked for.
       *
       * DO NOT JUDGE THIS ON answer_gate_shown. Opening a card fires the gate,
       * so that number is about to go from 16/65 to nearly every arrival, and
       * it will look like a triumph while proving only that I forced it. The
       * metric is EMAIL_SUBMITTED PER ARCHIVE ARRIVAL — 2 unlocks from 65 over
       * the two days before this. Watch `answer_gate_shown -> email_submitted`
       * too: if the rate per gate collapses while emails per arrival stay flat,
       * this is showing the ask to people who were never going to give one,
